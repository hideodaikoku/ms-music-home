Karaoke is a reproduction of a musical performance by musical accompaniment recorded in advance, instead of a live music, when one sings a song or plays a melody part (main part) on an instrument.\
Furthermore, Daisuke INOUE provided a service called '8 JUKE' including the production of a music source, a reproduction device, and a sales method for the public, which popularly became known as 'karaoke.'\
This 'karaoke' has widely spread and most people mean this one when they say 'karaoke'. In terms of function, the former is often regarded as a part of the latter. However, strictly speaking, the ranges of use are different between the former and the latter. Furthermore, not only the latter but also the former are currently-used active words.
